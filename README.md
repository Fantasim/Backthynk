## What is this?

BackThynk is a personal knowledge dump. 

Not a blog, not a wiki - something in between.

Think Twitter timeline but for your brain. 

Create spaces, nest them, throw in quick thoughts, attach files, and actually find them later.

## Core Features

### 🎯 Spaces & Subspaces
Organize thoughts hierarchically. 

Create "Work > Projects > ClientName" or "Learning > Go > Snippets"

### 📝 Quick Posts
No titles, no formatting pressure. 

Just write and post. 140 or 10,000 characters - your choice. 

Markdown support (coming soon)

### 📎 File Attachments
Drag & drop anything. PDFs, videos, images. 

They live with your thoughts, not in some separate media library.

### 📅 Timeline View
See everything chronologically. 

Filter by space. Search (coming soon).

### 🌙 Dark/Light Mode
Easy on the eyes at 3 AM.

### ⚡ Incredibly Low-Weight and Performant 
**Frontend**: **37.7KB** (Brotli) / 44.7KB (gzip) - entire app

**Backend**: **~0.6MB RAM** idle 

**SQLite database**: **no external dependencies**

<br />

## Use Cases

- **Daily Journaling** : Quick entries without the blog overhead
- **Project Notes** : Keep context with your files
- **Learning Log** : Track what you're studying with resources attached
- **Job Applications** : Space per company, posts with resumes/covers attached
- **Bookmarking++** : Not just links but your thoughts about them
- **Code Snippets** : That thing you figured out at 2 AM and will forget

## The Philosophy

**I built this because I needed a place for incomplete thoughts.**

Most note-taking apps want you to write documents, but I just wanted somewhere to dump the 10 things bouncing around my head without thinking about structure, formatting, or whether it's "good enough".

### Why Another Note App?

1. **Blogs are too heavy** - I don't want to write an introduction, body, and conclusion for a Docker command I'll forget
2. **Wikis are too structured** - Not everything fits in a knowledge graph
3. **Social media is too public** - These are my thoughts and I dont want models to be built with them.
4. **Most note apps are too complex** - I don't need databases, tags, backlinks, and 47 different views

### Design Principles

- **Start minimal**, add as needed - Features are opt-in, not opt-out
- **No feature coupling** - Enable file uploads without enabling markdown. Each feature stands alone.
- **Respect the user's machine** - 38KB for a full app.
- **No surprises** - Vanilla JS might be "harder" but it's predictable
- **Own your data** - SQLite database you can read with any tool

### Technical Choices

- **Go + SQLite**: Portable, fast, single binary distribution
- **Vanilla JS**: No framework churn, no build steps, no node_modules
- **Tailwind (minimal)**: Just enough styling without the bloat
- **Unit tested backend**: The foundation is solid, the UI can evolve

<br />

## Current Limitations

This is a working prototype that I use daily, but :

- **Single user only** - No authentication system yet (coming soon)
- **No public sharing** - This is your personal space for now (coming soon)
- **Basic search** - Full-text search (coming soon)
- **No post format** - Markdown support in a Github style standard (coming soon)

### Roadmap Ideas

- Full-text search with SQLite FTS5
- Markdown support within posts (github style format)
- Integrate a self-hosted tiny LLM model to provide custom vizualisation in a Space. (Example: Turn raw text into a more comfortable format to synthetize and analyze)
- Import from Twitter/Mastodon archives


### Contributing
The codebase is intentionally simple. No framework magic, no abstract patterns. If you know Go and JavaScript, you can contribute.

Key files:

- cmd/server/main.go - Entry point
- internal/api/router.go - HTTP routes
- internal/storage/ - Database layer
- web/static/js/main.js - Frontend logic
